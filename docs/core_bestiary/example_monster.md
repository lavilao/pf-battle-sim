> Ravenous and cruel, the sahuagin are, unfortunately, among the most prosperous oceanic races. Great cities raised by these creatures darken the deep ocean trenches, and many are the near-coastal fortresses where they launch endless raids against their air-breathing enemies who dwell in close proximity to the shore. Warlike and proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most other aquatic races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.<br /><br />Sahuagin are prone to beneficial mutations, and when a mutant is born it almost always rises to the society’s nobility or rulership. The most common sahuagin mutation is an extra pair of arms (granting two additional claw attacks or the opportunity to wield more weapons). Rumors speak of the rare malenti—sahuagin who look not like sharkmen but aquatic elves, yet who share their kin’s bloodlusts and cruel natures. Malenti often serve as spies and assassins for sahuagin rulers, but rumors of all-malenti tribes in isolated reaches of the sea persist.

### Description

Ravenous and cruel, the sahuagin are, unfortunately, among the most prosperous oceanic races. Great cities raised by these creatures darken the deep ocean trenches, and many are the near-coastal fortresses where they launch endless raids against their air-breathing enemies who dwell in close proximity to the shore. Warlike and proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most other aquatic races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.

Sahuagin are prone to beneficial mutations, and when a mutant is born it almost always rises to the society’s nobility or rulership. The most common sahuagin mutation is an extra pair of arms (granting two additional claw attacks or the opportunity to wield more weapons). Rumors speak of the rare malenti—sahuagin who look not like sharkmen but aquatic elves, yet who share their kin’s bloodlusts and cruel natures. Malenti often serve as spies and assassins for sahuagin rulers, but rumors of all-malenti tribes in isolated reaches of the sea persist.

## Sahuagin Mutants

Inherent instability in sahuagin genes makes them susceptible to mutations. Not all these mutations are beneficial, and defective sahuagin rarely survive long after hatching. Sahuagin mutants that do survive and grow to adulthood command the respect and admiration of their peers, quickly rising to positions of power. Four-armed sahuagin and malenti are the most common forms of mutated sahuagin.

**Four-Armed Sahuagin**: These mutants have four arms, giving them two additional claw attacks. Four-armed sahuagin gain Multiattack and Toughness as bonus feats, and gain the multiweapon mastery ability (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 299). They have a base CR of 3. Four-armed sahuagin excel as barbarians, fighters, and rangers.

**Malenti**: A malenti resembles an aquatic elf, and receives a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, gains Deceitful and Skill Focus (Bluff ) as bonus feats, and can use _command_ as a spell-like ability three times per day (this ability works only on creatures with the aquatic subtype, representing increased telepathic influence over aquatic creatures). Additionally, a malenti’s natural armor bonus decreases to +2 and the malenti loses its light blindness and natural weapons. Malenti excel as bards, oracles, rogues, and wizards.

**Prehistoric Sahuagin**: Also known as adacthys, these sahuagin mutants are throwbacks to a more savage epoch; they’re Large, have a +7 natural armor bonus, and can speak with aquatic dinosaurs and aquatic megafauna in addition to sharks. Adacthys are usually found in the same waters as prehistoric creatures.

**Shark-Blooded Sahuagin**: These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled with rows of shark-like teeth, as well as the fins and tail of an oversized shark. These abnormalities give them the appearance of monstrous merfolk, a base speed of 5 feet, a swim speed of 80 feet, a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, and immunity to trip attempts. Shark-blooded sahuagin are typically found in sahuagin communities with an unusually high number of shark guardians or near shark breeding grounds.

**Sightless Sahuagin**: These pallid, sickly looking sahuagin lack eyes, but their blindsense increases to 90 feet and they gain Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. A glowing tendril protruding from a sightless sahuagin causes all sighted creatures to be dazzled while within 10 feet of the sahuagin, and allows it to use _animal trance_ once per day as a spell-like ability. This _animal trance_ effect is entirely visual, so it doesn’t have the sonic descriptor or work on blind creatures. As sightless sahuagin are blind, they are immune to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks. Isolated sightless sahuagin mutants arise near sites of ancient evil, and make even other sahuagin uneasy. Whole tribes of such mutants dwell in deep underwater trenches and caves, lost cities at the bottom of oceans, and cursed aquatic temples.

**Spined Sahuagin**: Covered in hundreds of needlelike spines, spined sahuagin can raise their piercing protrusions to impale creatures that touch them. Any creature that successfully grapples or is grappled by a spined sahuagin, or hits one with an unarmed strike or natural weapon, takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain Defensive Combat Training and Improved Grapple as bonus feats. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths, or other massive aquatic predators.
